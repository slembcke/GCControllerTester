GCControllerTester
==================

Extremely simple app that displays the values of an iOS 7 GCController (extended profile only).

Some interesting things to note:
* The DPad is actually 4 pressure sensitive analog buttons. A little weird, but potentially mildly useful.
* Because the buttons are pressure sensitive, making them "click" doesn't necessarily give them enough pressure to register as a button press. This is a little annoying. Hopefully this is just a Moga Ace problem and not how the controllers are supposed to work.
* The analog sticks on the Moga Ace are really quite nice. Of the 3 USB gamepads I've owned, they have all been _awful_. (Macally, Logitech, and... another one) None of them centered properly and I swear they had like ~4 bits of resolution.
* The joysticks are circular, but their output is rectangular. Not sure if that happens on the software or hardware side.

Now I should make an actual game with it. ;)
